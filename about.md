# Comment Mentions
Have you ever wanted to get notified every time someone mentioned you in a comment section? (like, your username?). No? Well too bad, since I made it into a Geode mod.

Now, everytime someone mentions you* in the level specified in settings (defaults to current daily, for the daily chatters 🙂), you get a notification for it!

**you* as in the tags you specified in settings. you must specify them since they don't default to your current username
