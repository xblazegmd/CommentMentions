# Contributing Guidelines
So you wanna contribute? Great! Contributors are always appreciated when developing mods like this. But please follow the following guidelines when doing so.

## First time contributing?
Well, if that's you, welcome to the contributing world! We have a dedicated docs page on [how to contribute](./docs/how_to_contribute.md), so *after* you've read the rules in here (or before if you want, but plz read the rules in here), you can check out the guide to help you make your first contribution.

## Bug Reporting
Please be sure that the bug *is* related with CommentMentions specifically, and it not related with another mod, mod combination, or Geode itself. Make sure your bug hasn't been reported and/or fixed already.

All bug reports *must* be made with the "Bug Report" form in the issues page.

## Suggestions
Make sure your suggestion hasn't been suggested and/or implemented already. Make sure to add labels to your suggestion that are related with what the suggestion is.

All feature suggestions *must* be made with the "Feature Suggestion" form in the issues page. Any other suggestion must be made with the "Suggestion" form instead.

## PRs
Make sure you have properly tested the feature you are working in. No one likes untested PRs.

All PRs *must* be targeting the `dev` branch if they're changing anything related to the code (e.g. new features, bug fixes, refactors, etc). Documentation changes don't have to target to `dev`, and can easily target `main`

## Commit messages
Please make sure all commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. It may feel weird at first, but it makes it easier to understand and read commits.

Commits without this specification may be edited later to contain it, don't stress about it.

## Code styling
Please make sure to follow the [code styling guidelines](./docs/code_styling.md). They're just there to ensure code styling is consistent across all of the code (and to make sure .NET developers don't ruin my code, you'll see what I mean).
