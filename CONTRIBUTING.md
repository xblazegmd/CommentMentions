# Contributing Guidelines
So you wanna contribute? Great! Contributors are always appreciated when developing mods like this. But please follow the following guidelines when doing so.

## Bug Reporting
Please be sure that the bug is related with CommentMentions specifically, and it not related with another mod, mod combination, or Geode itself. Make sure your bug hasn't been reported and/or fixed already.

All bug reports must be made with the "Bug Report" form in the issues page.

## Suggestions
Make sure your suggestion hasn't been suggested and/or implemented already. Make sure to add labels to your suggestion that are related with what the suggestion is.

All feature suggestions must be made with the "Feature Suggestion" form in the issues page. Any other suggestion must be made with the "Suggestion" form instead.

## PRs
Make sure you have properly tested the feature you are working in. No one likes untested PRs.

All PRs mus* be targeting the `dev` branch if they're changing anything related to the code (e.g. new features, bug fixes, refactors, etc). README changes (or just any changes not related to code at all) don't have to target to `dev`, and can easily target `main`
