# So you wanna contribute?
Great! This guide's just for you. Since there's many ways you (yes, you) can contribute to this mod, and many other things you need to have in mind when doing so. Anyways, let's get to it!

## Playtesting
Wanna playtestthe pre-release versions of this mod? Well, here's a quick how-to guide on how to playtest the mod

### Download the pre-release version of the mod
Pre-release versions are available on https://github.com/xblazegmd/CommentMentions/releases. You'll know if the version is a pre-release if:
- It has the `Pre-release` mark (duh)
- It contains pre-release suffixes. Pre-release suffixes contain:
    - -dev
    - -alpha.*
    - -beta.*
    - -rc.*

### Install the mod on Geode
With the .geode file downloaded, open Geode, open the Geode menu in-game, and choose the button with a "file with a plus sign inside" like icon. Now choose the .geode file, and restart GD. The mod should be installed!

### Try it out!
Just use the mod how it's meant to be used. Don't just test it in this lab sorta way where you test the mod to it's limits, no, just try to use it properly. Found an issue? Report it to the GitHub with the guide below. Have suggestions? Post them in the GitHub with the guide below. That is what makes good playtesters.

## Bug reporting
Found a bug in the mod? Well GitHub has this handy Issues tool in which you can report bugs, ask questions, etc. But here's a how-to guide on how to report bugs specifically.

### Get more information
Get everything you can that can help with debugging. Whether it's screenshots, game logs, crash logs (if the bug specifically crashes the game), etc, all of them are aprecciated. In the case of game logs, it's reccomended to only show the ones relevant to the bug (like error logs, or just only the logs by the mod itself). It's a waste of time to show logs that have nothing to do with the bug, let alone the mod.

### Create a new issue
Go to the "Issues" tab on the repository, and select "New Issue". Now, select the "Bug report" template, and fill in the blanks with the information specified in there. It's reccomended to use it, but if you don't want to, it's fine! You're only really required to add the "bug" tag.

Now, with that done, press "Create", and you just reported the bug

### Follow up
If I request more information about the bug then you should follow up on the request. This is a team effort with the sole objective of working together to fix this stupid bug.

## Suggestions
Suggestions can also be done with GitHub issues. Here's another how-to guide on how to suggest changes.

### Get a solid idea
Think about what you want to do. Is it a feature? A refactor? How could it be impletented? It's reccomended to concretize your request into smaller chunks. For example:
> *"This thing could be nicer"*

What exactly does "nicer" mean here? Try to break it into smaller problems like:

> *"This thing could have a better input"*

> *"This thing could switch to using this thing for user input*"

Sure, this example isn't the most mod related example, but it still gives you a better idea on how to get a more solid idea on your suggestion.

### Make a new issue
o to the "Issues" tab on the repository, and select "New Issue". Now, select the "Suggestion" template, and fill in the blanks with the information specified in there. Make sure to add tags related to what specifically your suggestion is (e.g. a feature, a refactor, etc). Again, it's reccomended to use it, but if you don't want to, it's fine! You're only really required to add the "suggestion" tag, alongside one explaning more exactly what the suggestion is.

Now, with that done, press "Create", and you just made a suggestion

### Follow up
If I have any issues, suggestions, or just want more information, it's very important for you to follow up to me. How else am I gonna see your vision?
